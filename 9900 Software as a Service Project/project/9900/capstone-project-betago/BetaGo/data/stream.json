        "overview": "Recent technological advances are bringing robots out of their usual industrial settings and into homes and offices. Mobile robots capable of vacuum cleaning and lawn mowing are already commercially available. As miniaturisation and sophistication increase and costs continue to decrease, it is anticipated that robots will become commonplace. Applications include domestic robots to assist in everyday chores, robots for entertainment or educational purposes as well as robots for automating office and factory tasks. Applications also include assistance for the elderly, in particular, to improve their mobility and level of care.\nAs autonomous devices become more common, potential employers include companies that can make ready use of automation. This includes companies concerned with home and office automation, entertainment companies and autonomous systems research and development. Autonomous systems and the sophisticated sensors they employ are also adopted in many industries to enhance production and to improve safety (e.g. mining, manufacturing, transport).\nThe Artificial Intelligence stream in the Graduate Diploma and Master of Information Technology programs focuses on the development of sophisticated software for mobile robot control. Several aspects of software are considered:\nartificial intelligence;agent programming;experimental robotics;knowledge representation and reasoning;machine learning;robot architectures;human-computer interaction;vision.",

        "overview": "Database management systems (DBMSs) provide essential infrastructure for handling the large volumes of data required by modern enterprises: corporate, government, scientific and educational. How database systems are applied can critically affect the success of an organisation. In the future, the management of very large volumes of organisational data will be an essential component of the livelihood and growth of every organisation.\n\nSince databases are so widely used, potential employers include any organisation that relies on the effective management of data. Obvious examples of large organisations with significant data management needs are financial institutions, telecommunications companies, manufacturing enterprises, and government departments. However, employment is not limited to such organisations, since data management is also critical in medium and small enterprises, such as scientific research labs and small businesses.\n\nThe Database Systems stream in the Graduate Diploma and Master of Information Technology programs exposes students both to the foundations of DBMS architecture (essential knowledge for database administrators) as well as to the principles behind leading edge applications of databases, such as e-Commerce, data warehousing, and data mining.",

Typical applications concern both B2C (Business-to-Customer) and B2B (Business-to-Business). They include e-government, e-banking, and e-health. e-Commerce systems engineering requires the understanding of the requirements of business processes (e.g., security, public policy, project management) and the effective use of the IT infrastructure for implementation. The development of e-enterprise systems must also take into consideration technological, managerial, and legal aspects.\n\nIn order to capitalise on opportunities in the emerging digital economy, organisations are re-inventing themselves as e-enterprises. More importantly, both business and government organisations need skilled IT professionals in e-commerce systems engineering to provide necessary IT support.\n\nThe e-Commerce Systems stream in the Graduate Diploma and Master of Information Technology programs exposes students to the foundations of e-Commerce systems and architectures, and to software engineering principles and techniques for building and managing such systems. The major also provides interdisciplinary background in the areas of e-Commerce management and policy, covering the legal aspect of e-Commerce, and effectively integrating all components in the development of e-enterprise systems. Students will be given the opportunity to put theory into practice by designing and implementing a large e-enterprise system.",

The internet is the substrate and chief communications backbone for the world wide web that provides for the flow of data between applications that may be geographically distributed. How can a network operator guarantee that its resources are utilised properly? How can the network guarantee that the users and applications receive a desired level of service? Are there better ways of designing/implementing protocols for communications? These non-trivial problems must be solved for successful internetworking.\n\nThe Internetworking stream is suitable for graduates with an interest in the field of networking. The stream prepares graduates for employment as network engineers, telecommunication and network software developers, research scientists, network administrators.\n\nThe Internetworking stream in the Graduate Diploma and Master of Information Technology programs exposes students to the building blocks of the internet, routing algorithms and switching techniques for new networking requirements with an emphasis on the next generation of internet architectures and protocols. Students will develop skills in performance analysis and capacity planning to cope with projected higher loads.",
